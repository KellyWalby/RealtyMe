RealtyMe: A Real Estate Social Media Network

BACKGROUND
	RealtyMe is a iOS based mobile application that is deisgned to help users find 
	homes, connect with realtors, and get tailored listing suggestions. RealtyMe
	uses a collaborative recommendation engine to compare bookmarks between users, 
	find similarities, and recommend similarities to other users. The user 
	interface is designed to be simple and easy to use, whether the user is a
	realtor or a home buyer.

IMPLEMENTATION
	To implement this vision, we used the Swift language and XCode to create a 
	user interface and logical source code. For database service, we used Google 
	Firebase to create a live database to be used by the application. XCode 
	allowed for visual user interface design combined with logical code for 
	simultaneous design between the user interface and background processes.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
	1. Download XCode with iOS mobile simulator
